## Product Research

`category-certification-checkpoint-october-3.md` records 231 independently reviewed and applied corrections,
637 confirmed clue-scroll placements, 939 confirmed equipment placements, 40 ordinary foods, 21 raw-fish Cooking inputs, 72 consumable player-transport items, 23 ordinary spellcasting runes, 151 tools, 51 ordinary planting seeds, pinned exact-ID evidence and validation. It explicitly records that full preset certification
remains incomplete; earlier export-wide passes were not a certification of every assignment.
`category-certification/approved-assignments.tsv` accounts for all 34,085 IDs and separates the
2,165 approved primary assignments from the 31,920 that remain unresolved.

`item-role-audit-final-october-2.md` records the final clue/quest/equipment batch, conditional
cleanup protections, whole-export coverage measurement and the ingame test checklist.

`item-role-audit-utility-storage-october-2.md` records six repeatable-utility catalog decisions,
33 usage rows and the first seven conditional alternative-storage hints.

`item-role-audit-skilling-october-2.md` records skilling outfit coverage, the Guild hunter /
Golden prospector layout additions and user-visible usage facts in blueprint tooltips.

`item-role-audit-functional-october-2.md` records the second batch: four functional gear
corrections and the first independently curated exact-ID usage facts loaded by the plugin.

`item-role-audit-october-2.md` and its TSV ledger track the first exact-ID cosmetic corrections
and pending overlapping quest, clue and skilling roles from the October placement research.

`plugin-hub-placement-and-cleanup-october-2.md` records the October 2026 public-feature survey,
our classification baseline, and an original plan for item usage roles and conditional cleanup.
It distinguishes verified local measurements, plugin README claims and gameplay research candidates.

`existing-bank-plugin-research.md` captures C4a product research on existing RuneLite Plugin Hub
plugins related to banks, inventories, setups, exports, cleanup, bank tags, layouts, value, search,
and external storage. It is product positioning research only; do not copy third-party code, UI,
resources, naming, layouts, configuration structures, or implementation details.

## Item ID Research Index

`item-id-research-index.tsv` is generated from the local RuneLite API source cache by:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\generate-item-id-research-index.ps1
```

The generator reads `net/runelite/api/gameval/ItemID.java` from the cached RuneLite sources jar and
classifies constants with simple heuristics. The output is useful for catalog research, owned-bank
layout planning, and finding candidate items for curated category batches.

Production rules:

- Keep `StaticItemCatalog` curated.
- Do not bulk-import this TSV into production.
- Treat `exclude-main-catalog` rows as research-only unless explicitly reviewed.
- Treat `LOW` confidence rows as suggestions, not truth.
- Prefer organizing items the player actually owns over building missing-item checklists.

## Category Classifier Report

`category-classifier-report.md` and `category-classifier-detail.tsv` are generated from the
production item registry by:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\generate-category-report.ps1
```

Use this report to improve broad classifier rules across the full item registry instead of tuning
rules only from one player's current bank.
